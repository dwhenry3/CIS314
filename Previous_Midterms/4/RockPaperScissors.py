#Rock Paper Scissors Game
#by Joey Williams, Dylan Kelley, and Chase Bowers.
#This program asks the user to pick rock, paper, or scissors and then picks rock, paper, or scissors itself at random to play a game of rock, paper, scissors.
#The program also prints out the score and win rate percentage of your games.
#The goals of this project were to use the random module, input, while and for loops, and if statements to create a virtual game of rock, paper, scissors.
